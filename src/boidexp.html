          <strong>Boid's Algorithm:</strong> This fascinating algorithm is a prime example of the complex and intelligent behavior that emerges from simple rules. Inspired by the flocking behavior of birds, it simulates the movements of entities like birds or fish. By employing principles of separation, alignment, and cohesion, Boid's Algorithm creates intricate and visually stunning patterns of movement that mimic natural behavior.

          <strong>Why This Project?</strong> My journey into Boid's Algorithm stems from my passion for neuroscience and a keen interest in understanding natural patterns. The project represents an amazing intersection of algorithms and natural phenomena. The aim was not just to develop an algorithm but to capture the essence of natural flocking behavior, creating a bridge between computational models and the elegance of nature's patterns.
