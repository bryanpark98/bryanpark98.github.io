                <strong>Self-Ordering System for Restaurants</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Overview:</strong> Yori is an app designed to allow customers to effortlessly submit orders from their tables using a tablet, incorporating a unique gesture-based interface inspired by gaming UI. The app not only caters to customers but also empowers the staff to manage orders efficiently, both electronically and manually.<br><br>
                <strong>Innovative Gesture System:</strong> Yori introduces a novel gesture system where holding an item on the menu presents additional options, akin to interactive game mechanics. This engaging feature enhances the user experience, making the act of ordering both intuitive and enjoyable.<br><br>
                <strong>Project Status:</strong> Yori is currently under active development. Stay tuned for more updates and exciting features!<br>
            </p>

                <strong>Why Yori?:</strong> The concept for Yori was born from my love for gaming and the desire to apply its interactive elements to real-world applications. I was curious why more restaurants weren't implementing self-ordering systems, and I realized that the lack of a user-friendly interface was a major barrier. Yori is my attempt to bridge the gap between gaming and real-world applications, creating a fun and engaging ordering experience for customers.
